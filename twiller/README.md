Twiller - A Modern Social Media Platform
Twiller is a feature-rich social media web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and integrated with Firebase for robust authentication and user management. It's designed to provide a dynamic and interactive user experience, incorporating several advanced features beyond a typical clone.

‚ú® Features
üë§ User Authentication: Secure user registration and login using email/password and Google OAuth, powered by Firebase Authentication.

üìù Dynamic Posting Rules: A "Public Space" concept where a user's ability to post is tied to their social engagement:

0 Following: Can post once a day, only between 10:00 AM and 10:30 AM IST.

1-10 Following: Can post up to twice a day.

10+ Following: Can post an unlimited number of times.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Custom Video Player: An interactive, gesture-based video player for all video content:

Single Tap (Center): Play/Pause.

Double Tap (Center): Toggle fullscreen.

Double Tap (Left/Right): Seek 10 seconds backward/forward.

Triple Tap (Center): Automatically finds and scrolls to the next video in the feed.

Triple Tap (Left): Toggles the comment section.

Triple Tap (Right): Opens a confirmation dialog to close the website.

üîê Secure Password Reset: A "Forgot Password" flow that generates a random, secure password (no special characters or numbers) and emails it to the user. Includes a rate limit of one request per 24 hours.

üåç Multi-Language Support: The application supports 6 languages (English, Spanish, Hindi, French, Portuguese, Chinese). Switching languages requires OTP verification for security:

French: Requires a one-time password (OTP) sent to the user's registered email.

Other Languages: Requires OTP verification via the user's registered and verified phone number.

üë• Social Features: Users can follow/unfollow others, view profiles, and see posts from the people they follow in their main feed.

üí¨ Interactive Posts: Users can post text, images, and videos, and reply to posts in a comment section.
